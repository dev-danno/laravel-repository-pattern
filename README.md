## Installation ðŸ“Œ

- Require the package using composer.
```bash
    composer require dev-danno/laravel-repository-pattern --dev
```

- Laravel uses Auto-Discovery, so it doesn't require to manually add the ServiceProvider.

- Publish the config file
```php
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=repository-pattern-config
```

## Usage ðŸ§°

> [!NOTE]
> When using `interface --repository` or `model --csir` commands, it will automatically create the custom ServiceProvider & register it.
